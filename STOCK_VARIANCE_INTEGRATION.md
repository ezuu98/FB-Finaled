# Stock Variance Integration with Dynamic Opening Stock Calculation

## Overview

This document describes the integration of stock variance adjustments into the dynamic opening stock calculation system. The integration uses your existing stock variance API to automatically adjust opening stock calculations with variance corrections applied before the calculation date.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Component Updates (`sku-detail-view.tsx`)

#### Modified `calculateDynamicOpeningStock` Function
- **Before**: Only considered base inventory and historical movements
- **After**: Now includes stock variance adjustments fetched from your existing API
- **Implementation**: 
  - Fetches cumulative stock variance before the start date using the existing `/stock-corrections/variance-before-date/{productId}` endpoint
  - Applies variance adjustments to the calculated opening stock for each warehouse
  - Maintains backward compatibility for dates before July 1, 2025

#### Updated State Management
- Changed `calculateDynamicOpeningStock` from synchronous to asynchronous
- Updated `warehouseData` useMemo to use state-based opening stocks
- Modified `fetchStockMovementData` to call the async opening stock calculation

## How It Works

### 1. Opening Stock Calculation Flow
```
Base Inventory + Historical Movements + Stock Variance (from API) = Final Opening Stock
```

### 2. Variance Integration Process
1. **Frontend**: Fetches historical movements and variance data before start date
2. **API Call**: Uses existing `/stock-corrections/variance-before-date/{productId}` endpoint
3. **Variance Application**: Cumulative variance before the date is added to opening stock
4. **Result**: Opening stock reflects both movement history and variance corrections

### 3. Data Sources
- **Base Inventory**: `warehouse_inventory` table (via existing logic)
- **Historical Movements**: `stock_movements` table (via existing logic)
- **Stock Variance**: Your existing stock variance API (no changes needed)

## Benefits

### 1. Accuracy
- Opening stock now reflects actual stock counts from variance corrections
- Eliminates discrepancies between calculated and actual stock levels

### 2. Consistency
- Frontend calculations now include variance adjustments
- Stock continuity is maintained across date ranges

### 3. Simplicity
- **No database changes required** - uses your existing API
- **No backend modifications** - variance logic stays in one place
- **More flexible** - you can modify variance logic without touching the database

## Usage Examples

### Frontend (React)
```typescript
// Opening stock now automatically includes variance adjustments from your API
const openingStocks = await calculateDynamicOpeningStock();
// openingStocks[warehouseCode] includes variance adjustments
```

### API Endpoint (Already Exists)
```typescript
// Your existing endpoint provides variance data
GET /stock-corrections/variance-before-date/{productId}?date={startDate}
```

## Testing

### 1. Verify Frontend Integration
- Check browser console for variance adjustment logs
- Verify opening stock calculations include variance adjustments
- Test with products that have variance corrections

### 2. Test API Integration
- Ensure `/stock-corrections/variance-before-date/{productId}` endpoint works
- Verify variance data is correctly applied to opening stock calculations

## Migration Notes

### 1. Backward Compatibility
- Existing code continues to work without modification
- New variance-adjusted calculations are applied automatically
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

### 2. Performance Impact
- Minimal performance impact - one additional API call per opening stock calculation
- Variance data is fetched once per calculation
- No database performance impact

### 3. Data Requirements
- Uses your existing `stock_corrections` table and API
- No additional database setup required

## Troubleshooting

### 1. No Variance Adjustments Applied
- Check if your variance API endpoint is working
- Verify `stock_corrections` table has data
- Check API response format and error handling

### 2. Incorrect Opening Stock Values
- Review variance correction dates and quantities
- Verify movement type classifications in stock movements
- Check API response data structure

### 3. API Issues
- Verify endpoint URL and authentication
- Check network requests in browser dev tools
- Ensure proper error handling for API failures

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Caching
- Cache variance calculations for frequently accessed date ranges
- Implement local storage caching for better performance

### 2. Real-time Updates
- WebSocket notifications for variance corrections
- Automatic recalculation of affected opening stocks

### 3. Advanced Variance Types
- Support for different variance categories
- Time-weighted variance calculations
- Variance approval workflows

## Conclusion

The integration of stock variance into dynamic opening stock calculation provides a more accurate and consistent inventory management system. The implementation uses your existing API infrastructure, requiring no database changes or backend modifications. This approach is simpler, more maintainable, and leverages your existing architecture effectively.
